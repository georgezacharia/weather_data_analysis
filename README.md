## 🛠️ Tools and Data

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Range**: 2012 (8,784 hourly observations)

## 📊 Dataset Overview

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Date/Time | object | Timestamp of observation |
| Temp_C | float64 | Temperature in Celsius |
| Dew Point Temp_C | float64 | Dew point temperature in Celsius |
| Rel Hum_% | int64 | Relative humidity percentage |
| Wind Speed_km/h | int64 | Wind speed in km/h |
| Visibility_km | float64 | Visibility in km |
| Press_kPa | float64 | Atmospheric pressure in kPa |
| Weather | object | Weather condition description |

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1. 🌡️ Temperature Extremes

- Hottest day: 33.0°C (June 21, 2012)
- Coldest day: -23.3°C (January 15, 2012)

### 2. 💧 Temperature vs. Relative Humidity

- Weak negative correlation: -0.22
- Suggests higher temperatures generally correspond to lower humidity

### 3. 💨 Wind Speed Analysis

- Wind speed on hottest day: 24 km/h
- Wind speed on coldest day: 7 km/h

### 4. 👀 Visibility Analysis

- Visibility on both hottest and coldest days: 24.1 km

### 5. 📅 Seasonal Temperature Trends

- Warmest month: July (avg. 22.79°C)
- Coldest month: January (avg. -7.37°C)

### 6. 🍃 Seasonal Wind Speed Trends

- Windiest month: January (avg. 18.11 km/h)
- Calmest month: July (avg. 11.89 km/h)

### 7. ⛅ Common Weather Conditions

1. Mainly Clear (2,106 observations)
2. Mostly Cloudy (2,069 observations)
3. Cloudy (1,728 observations)

## 💡 Interpretations and Impact

1. **Seasonal Variations**: Significant temperature fluctuations between summer and winter affect energy consumption, outdoor activities, and agriculture.

2. **Wind Patterns**: Stronger winds in winter may increase wind chill effect and heating needs.

3. **Visibility**: Consistent good visibility suggests generally clear air quality, beneficial for transportation and outdoor activities.

4. **Humidity-Temperature Relationship**: The weak negative correlation indicates that warmer days tend to be less humid, potentially affecting comfort levels and water demand.

5. **Weather Conditions**: Predominantly clear to cloudy conditions, with occasional precipitation, impacts daily life and outdoor planning.

## 📝 Recommendations

As a weather data analyst, I, George Zacharia, recommend the following:

1. **Energy Management**: Implement seasonal energy strategies to manage heating and cooling demands efficiently.

2. **Urban Planning**: Consider wind patterns in city design to mitigate winter wind chill and promote summer ventilation.

3. **Agricultural Planning**: Align crop selection and planting schedules with temperature and precipitation patterns.

4. **Public Health**: Develop targeted health advisories for extreme temperature days, especially for vulnerable populations.

5. **Transportation**: Maintain high standards of road and air traffic management, leveraging generally good visibility conditions.

6. **Water Management**: Prepare for potential increased water demand during warmer, less humid periods.

7. **Renewable Energy**: Explore wind energy potential, particularly during windier winter months.

8. **Tourism and Recreation**: Plan outdoor events and activities according to seasonal weather patterns.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the local climate patterns and their potential impacts on various sectors. The data reveals a climate with distinct seasons, generally good visibility, and predominantly clear to cloudy conditions. These findings can inform decision-making in urban planning, energy management, agriculture, and public health initiatives.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of weather data will be crucial for adapting to changing climate patterns and mitigating their impacts on people and the environment.
